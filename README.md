### üõ† Tools Stack

| Tool            | Role / Purpose                                                                 |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Kubernetes**  | Core orchestration layer for containerized applications                        |
| **Prometheus**  | Collects, stores, and queries time-series metrics                              |
| **Grafana**     | Visualizes metrics and logs via customizable dashboards                        |
| **Loki**        | Lightweight log aggregator designed to integrate seamlessly with Grafana       |
| **Alertmanager**| Handles and routes alerts triggered by Prometheus alerting rules               |
| **Node Exporter** | Collects and exposes Linux system metrics (CPU, memory, disk, etc.) to Prometheus |

## üß© Project Section-wise Overview

### ‚úÖ Section 1: Prerequisites (Setup Your Local System)

- Docker: Required to run containers and Kind.
- Kubectl: CLI tool to interact with the Kubernetes cluster.
- Kind/Minikube: Used to spin up a local Kubernetes cluster for development.
- Helm: Package manager for Kubernetes used to install observability tools.

---

### ‚úÖ Section 2: Set Up Kubernetes Cluster

- Option to use either Kind or Minikube for a local cluster.
- Cluster setup ensures an environment to deploy and test observability tools.
- After setup, the cluster can be verified using kubectl commands.

---

### ‚úÖ Section 3: Added Helm Repositories

- Helm repositories for Prometheus and Grafana are added to fetch official Helm charts.
- This enables seamless installation of monitoring and logging stacks.

---

### ‚úÖ Section 4: Installed Monitoring Stack Using Helm

- Kube-Prometheus-Stack is installed, which includes:
   * Prometheus
   * Alertmanager
   * Node Exporter
   * Grafana

- Grafana is bundled within this stack for out-of-the-box visualization.
- Loki + Promtail are installed separately for centralized log collection.

---

### ‚úÖ Section 5: Deployed Sample App to Monitor & Log

- A simple NGINX deployment is created to generate application logs and metrics.
- Promtail (part of Loki stack) captures logs from the NGINX pods and forwards them to Loki.

---

### ‚úÖ Section 6: Created Dashboards in Grafana

- Prometheus is added as a data source in Grafana for metrics visualization.
- Loki is added as a data source in Grafana for viewing logs.
- Dashboards display:

  - Node and application metrics (CPU, memory, etc.)
  - Logs from the deployed NGINX app
  - Alerting rules and thresholds can be configured visually.

---

### ‚úÖ Section 7: Alerting with Alertmanager

- Alertmanager is automatically deployed with kube-prometheus-stack.
- UI available to view, silence, and test alerts.
- Alert delivery can be configured via email, Slack, or webhook integrations.

---

### ‚úÖ Section 8: Cleanup

- All deployed Helm charts and Kubernetes resources can be removed.
- The Kubernetes cluster itself can be deleted to free up local resources.
